I am a musician-turned-engineer with a deep love for creating innovative, intelligent audio software. My background in technology, music, and research drives me to specialize in AI-powered audio solutions that streamline creative workflows and solve complex, real-world communication challenges.

I focus on developing high-performance, low-latency audio plugins using C++ and the JUCE framework, ensuring every application meets the highest standards of sound quality and efficiency across all major operating systems.

Core Competencies & Research
Intelligent Audio Application Development: Building professional, intuitive plugins (VST/AU/AAX) designed for superior usability and sonic fidelity, often leveraging AI/ML for novel features.

Advanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP): Expertise in creating algorithms—from pristine digital processing to meticulously modeling the desirable characteristics of analog hardware.

PhD Research in ASR & AI: Actively researching and developing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems specifically tailored for dysarthric speech (impaired speech). This work focuses on applying advanced AI/ML to solve critical communication challenges.

Technical Toolkit

- Languages: C++, Rust, Python

– Frameworks: JUCE, VST3, AU, AAX

- DevOps & Tools: Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Unit Testing, CMake, NeoVim, MacOS/Linux
